Spotify platform... but with the look of a data analyst! 📊

In this project, I transformed Spotify's listening data into an analytics-rich interactive dashboard using Excel and Power BI, with the aim of detecting auditory patterns and understanding listening behavior more deeply.

the most important thing included in the analysis:

📌 Top 10: list of the 10 most listened songs in terms of time.

🎤 The 10 most listened artists.

📈 Listening trends across the months with an interactive graph.

🕒 Distribute listening to the Times of the day: morning, noon, evening, night.

📅 The most listened days of the week (graph of columns).

💻 Comparison of platforms used: web player, Mobile, TV.

🎯 Skip rate for each artist or album and analysis of the reasons for the termination of playback.

✅ The ratio of completed songs versus skipped ones.

📊 Performance indicators (KPIs) in the dashboard:

Total listening time.

The number of unique songs played.

The number of unique artists.

The average listening time for each song.

the result : an interactive dashboard that makes it easier for any user or company to understand their listening habits, improve the user experience, and make data-driven decisions.
